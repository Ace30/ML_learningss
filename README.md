## Introduction

Machine Learning is revolutionizing industries and driving innovation by allowing systems to automatically improve their performance with experience. This repository is designed as a learning guide for ML enthusiasts and practitioners. The goal is to cover a wide range of topics, from basic ML algorithms to advanced deep learning architectures, while also emphasizing practical applications.

## Motivation

The purpose of this repository is to track my learning progress, share insights, and build a resource that can be helpful for others who are also learning ML. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced professional, you can find something of value here, whether it be code snippets, tutorials, or real-world projects.

## Technologies Used

This repository uses a variety of tools and libraries commonly employed in machine learning projects, including:

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **scikit-learn**: For classical ML algorithms
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Deep learning frameworks
- **PyTorch**: An alternative deep learning library
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive environment for experimentation

## Getting Started

To get started with the repository, you can either explore the Jupyter Notebooks or run the Python scripts directly on your local machine.

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML_learnings.git
    cd ML_learnings
    ```

2. **Explore the notebooks and scripts**: Navigate through the folders to find code samples, algorithms, and projects.

3. **Run example scripts**: Inside the `scripts/` folder, you'll find Python files with implementations of various algorithms. You can run them to see how each model works.
